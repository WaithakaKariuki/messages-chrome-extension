# React + Vite chrome extension

## Features
- Show a badge icon when there are unread messages
- Display messages in a popup when the extension icon is clicked
- Allow users to mark messages as read
- Store message history locally
- Implement message categories or priority levels

### quick overview
1. Backend Integration
- Run "json-server --watch db.json" To run mock an API endpoint that would provide messages in this format:
```json
    {
    "messages": [
    {
    "id": "msg123",
    "content": "Team meeting at 3 PM today 🙂",
    "priority": "high",
    "timestamp": "2024-09-30T15:00:00Z",
    "read": false
    }
    ]
    }
```
2. Frontend Implementation
- Uses React for the popup UI
- Implement and manages state using useState and useReducer hooks
- Style the interface using CSS Tailwind

3. Extension Architecture
- Use Chrome storage API to persist message state
- Implements a background script to check for new messages periodically
- Handles different states: loading, error, no messages, unread messages

#### npm test or yarn test
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

Read more about testing.

#### npm run build or yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
